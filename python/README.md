# Python Challenges - Codewars

## Overview
This folder contains my solutions to Python coding challenges from Codewars. Each subfolder represents a different difficulty level of the challenges, starting from `8kyu` (least complex) and descending as the complexity increases (`7kyu`, `6kyu`, ...)

## Structure
- Folders are named according to the Codewars kyu level of the challenges.
- Inside each level folder, there's a separate folder for each challenge.
- Each challenge folder contains:
  - A `README.md` with the problem statement.
  - A solution file (`.py`) with my code and comments explaining the logic.

## Progress
As I continue to solve more challenges, I will update this folder with new solutions and potentially higher difficulty levels.

## Learning Journey
With each challenge, I aim to not only provide a solution but also understand deeper Python concepts and best coding practices.
