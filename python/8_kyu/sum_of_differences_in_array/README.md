**Challenge/Instructions:**

Your task is to sum the differences between consecutive pairs in the array in descending order.

**Example:**

```python
[2, 1, 10]  -->  9
```

In descending order: `[10, 2, 1]`

Sum: `(10 - 2) + (2 - 1) = 8 + 1 = 9`

If the array is empty or the array has only one element the result should be 0
